Notes on RXTX:

o rxtx v2.0 should be used with sun javax.comm packages and rxtx v2.1 should be used 
with the rxtx gnu.io package, but couldn't get the former to work

o javax.comm.properties should be set with 'driver=gnu.io.RXTXCommDriver'

o javax.comm.properties is suppose to load in a great number of ways, but the only 
way it would load for me is from working directory

o the jni lib and RXTXComm.jar need to go in /Library/Java/Extensions, this is 
always automatically added to your classpath (no need for java.library.path)

o the rxtx software uses locks for the ports ... these are placed in 
/var/lock (not /var/spool/uucp like it says in the docs) ... you should also be 
added to the uucp group and chgrp of /var/lock to uucp:

drwxrwxr-x     2 root    uucp      68 Oct 20 16:25 /var/lock 

o on mac, groups aren't set in /etc/group but with NetInfo; easiest to use 
/Applications/Utilities/NetInfo Manager.app but also util called niutil as well
